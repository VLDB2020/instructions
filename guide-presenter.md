# VLDB2020: Talk Recording Instructions for All Presenters

In preparation for the upcoming VLDB conference, we are asking authors to prepare and record their talks ahead of time to minimize technical problems during the conference itself, and to allow videos to be posted ahead of the conference.  To ensure that we have enough time to get the videos set up, we need your videos by **August 17th**, end of the day.  This is a hard deadline.

The plan is to run the conference in synchronous mode, with all talks available to registered participants via Zoom webinars with Slack channels for asynchronous communication afterwards.  We plan to make recordings available ahead of the conference to registered participants, and to allow presenters to opt-in to having their videos made publicly available after the conference.

In order to make sure that your presentation is able to be shown and of high quality, please make sure that you prepare a video that is in mp4 format. 

Video durations should be as follows:
- Keynote talks: 40 min (split into two parts)
- Award talks: 17 min
- Research or industry papers: 10 min
- Demonstrations: 7 min
- VLDBJ: 4 min
- Tutorials: A series of short videos is strongly recommended

Failure to adhere to video length and formatting constraints may result in your video not being shown. Any video that is 15 second longer than the time-limit above will not be shown.

Optional: We recommend that you use one of our [VLDB’20 backgrounds](https://vldb2020.org/material.html) when recording your talk. This is not required, but it would be nice to make our talks look fancier. You can select any of the available backgrounds.

We recommend you use the Zoom application (the installed version, not the web version) to record your talk.  You can create a new meeting, share your screen, and then start recording the meeting.  The recordings will be saved locally as mp4 files when you end the meeting after stopping recording.  Some specifics about the recording quality:

- The number one complaint that we have seen about talks in past online conferences is poor audio quality, so please:
    - Consider using earphones and a microphone rather than relying on your computer or phone’s built in options.
    - If you use a corded headphone with a mic, please make sure that the microphone does not brush against your clothes, since that causes audio disturbances.
    - Use an isolated room with no fish tanks or open windows.
    - Please do a test recording to ensure your audio quality is good, with no disturbance/echoes, before you do the main recording.
    - It is also recommended to start and end the recording with a smile.
- Use either full HD or 720p resolution.
    - Make sure your Zoom app and presentation app (e.g. PowerPoint) run in full-screen mode, since windowed-mode may generate a lower resolution mp4 file.
- We ask that you keep the picture-in-picture window that shows up automatically so viewers can see the speaker.

We will post instructions to upload your video in about a week. We first need to finalize the assignment of papers to sessions, which will then determine how you should name your video file.
