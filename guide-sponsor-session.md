# VLDB2020: Sponsor Session Instructions

**Zoom link**: You will find the link to the zoom webinar for your session on the interactive conference program ([https://vldb2020.org/program.html](https://vldb2020.org/program.html)). Just click on your session and you should see buttons for Zoom, Slack, and technical support. 

Please **do NOT share** the zoom link on social media or anywhere else where it might be found by a malicious party.  If you wish to share a link, please use `https://vldb2020.org/program_flat.html?s=[Session ID]`, replacing `[Session ID]` with the 2-digit+letter ID of your session.  (e.g., `https://vldb2020.org/program_flat.html?s=47C`). Registered participants will be able to access the zoom link from this page.

**Training Videos**: The following training videos from Gateway Productions explain Zoom [webinar mode](https://vimeo.com/427831814) and Zoomâ€™s [moderation tools](https://vimeo.com/430085119).  You may wish to review these videos.

**Support**:
- **Technical chair**: A technical chair from Gateway Production will be present. That person will take care of streaming the videos when you give them the signal. They have all the videos and they know the order. The technical chair can also help answer other questions that may come up during the session.
    - Because of the large number of concurrent events taking place during the social sessions, the technical chair may not be monitoring audio for your session at all times.  To communicate with the technical chair, please use the Zoom chat window.  Similarly, if the technical chair needs to communicate with you, it will be through chat, so **please monitor the Zoom chat window**.
- **Slack channel**: Additional Gateway Productions support staff will also be present in a dedicated support slack channel.
