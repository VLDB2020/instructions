# VLDB2020: Workshop Chair Instructions

**Zoom link**: You will find the link to the zoom webinar for your workshop on the interactive conference program ([https://vldb2020.org/program.html](https://vldb2020.org/program.html)). Just click on your session and you should see buttons for Zoom, Slack, paper pdf, and technical support. Please **do NOT share** the zoom link on social media or anywhere else where it might be found by a malicious party.

**Training Videos**: The following training videos from Gateway Productions explain Zoom [webinar mode](https://vimeo.com/427831814) and Zoomâ€™s [moderation tools](https://vimeo.com/430085119).  You and your session chairs (if applicable) should review these videos.

**Support**:
- **Technical chair**: A technical chair from Gateway Production will be present. That person will take care of streaming the videos when you give them the signal. They have all the videos and they know the order. The technical chair can also help answer other questions that may come up during the session.
- **Slack channel**: Additional Gateway Productions support staff will also be present in a dedicated support slack channel.
