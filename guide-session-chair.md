# VLDB2020: Session Chair Instructions

## Research and Industry Paper Sessions

Thank you for volunteering to chair a research session! In those sessions, research and industry papers are intertwined but industry papers are labeled as such in the program.


**Logistics**: Each session will be a zoom webinar. To give attendees the experience of a shared event, all attendees will be upgraded to panelists. This means that they will be able to see each other, privately chat with each other, and speak. If an attendee is disruptive (voluntarily or involuntarily), they will be demoted to attendee, losing their audio/video privileges.

**Zoom link**: You will find the link to the zoom webinar on the interactive conference program ([https://vldb2020.org/program.html](https://vldb2020.org/program.html)). Just click on your session and you should see buttons for Zoom, Slack, paper pdf, and technical support.

**Before The Conference**:
- Please review the following training videos, which explain Zoom [webinar mode](https://vimeo.com/427831814) and Zoom’s [moderation tools](https://vimeo.com/430085119).
- Please **email the authors** of the papers in your session. Make sure everyone has the right time for the session and please confirm (1) who will be giving the recorded talk (so you can introduce them propely) and who will be present to answer questions live. We ask the authors to be present at least one of the two times when their paper is presented, but many will be present both times.

Support:

- **Session co-chairs**: You are a team of two co-chairs, one primary and one secondary. The responsibility of the primary chair is to introduce the speakers, manage the live Q&A after each paper, and manage the discussion at the end of the session. The responsibility of the secondary chair is to take over if the primary becomes unavailable and to help the primary if present.
- **Technical chair**: A technical chair from Gateway Production will be present. That person will take care of streaming the videos when you give them the signal. They have all the videos and they know the order. The technical chair can also help answer other questions that may come up during the session.
- **Student volunteer**: A student volunteer will help you with two tasks:
    - Demote a disruptive person from panelist to attendee. We will ask the students to monitor and if they notice that someone is being disruptive, they will go ahead and demote them. If you notice that someone is disruptive, you can demote them directly yourself as well.
    - Copy over questions from the zoom Q&A to the Slack Channel. We will ask students to copy over all unanswered questions and, if possible, the questions that were answered (with their answers) as well.
- **Slack channel**: Additional Gateway Productions support staff will also be present in a dedicated support slack channel. 

**Structure of a session**: Please run your session as follows
- 5 minutes before session
    - Arrive in the Zoom channel early to check your camera/mic, identify yourself to the technical chair (who will promote you), and mitigate any technical difficulties.
- First 5 minutes 
    - Take 2 minutes for miscellaneous chit-chat. Both the primary and secondary chair can greet attendees as a whole. You can say things like: “Welcome to this session on *&lt;title of the session&gt;*. We will begin shortly.” You can also say “hi” to specific people that you recognize. Please also greet the speakers who join the session. The goal is to create a sense of a community of people coming together. 
    - Primary chair should then begin the session and do the following:
        - Say: “Welcome to the session on *&lt;title of the session&gt;*.”
        - Say: “We have three exciting papers in this session.” [A few sessions have only two papers].
        - Introduce the three papers: Read the title, the affiliations of the authors, and finally give the name of the presenter. Say the presenter’s full name properly (you can ask them ahead of time if you are not sure about the pronunciation).
        - Indicate if the presenter or another author is present to answer live Q&A or not. If the author is not present, then all questions will have to go to Slack. The interactive program will soon show when presenters are present. You can also see this information [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19oS-P9qDm66_8HVjh1CzeL0D3c2ke7gxIi60x62OYYM/edit?usp=sharing). 
        - Ask the attendees to keep their microphones muted to avoid disruptions.
    - For each paper
        - Ask the technical chair to play the recorded **10-min talk**
        - If an author is present to answer live questions, follow the paper by **2-5 min of questions using the zoom Q&A feature**. If authors of all three papers are present, aim for 2-3 min of questions. If only a subset of authors are present, you can have more time for questions for those papers.
    - Final discussion
        - After all the papers have been presented, you can have a group discussion.
        - The primary chair should start the discussion by asking a broad question to all authors (a panel-style question).
        - Then take more questions and comments from the audience. At this time, you can either use the zoom Q&A feature or you can let the audience members speak directly.
        - The secondary chair should contribute to the discussion.
    - BREAK
        - Make sure to end your session **7-10 min** before the end of the hour to give attendees enough time to get a coffee, get food, and stretch their legs before the next session.
    - Slack discussion
        - Make sure there is at least one unanswered question on the slack channel for your session. If there were no questions left unanswered, then please come up with a new question. There needs to be a question to get the conversation going.
        - And then you are done! Thanks.

    - Let the audience know the format of the session: We have 5 (or 6) demonstrations in this session.

Other questions should be asked on the slack channel. 
    - Ask the attendees to keep their microphones muted to avoid disruptions.
- For each demo
    - Ask the technical chair to play the recorded **7-min demonstration**.
    - If an author is present to answer live questions, follow the recorded demo with **1 min of questions using the zoom Q&A feature**. This really means enough time for 1 or 2 quick questions. The program will indicate which authors are present to answer live demo questions. This information is also available [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186astl6aVBiRFEHazp5fclBL0t1aYtINkvvnvCtLa9Y/edit?usp=sharing).
- BREAK
    - Make sure to end your session 5 min before the end of the hour to give attendees a short break before the next session. If your session has 6 demos, then you will not have time for a break.
- Slack discussion
    - Make sure there is at least one question on the slack channel for your session. If there were no questions left unanswered, then please come up with a new question. There needs to be a question to get the conversation going.
    - And then you are done! Thanks.

## Technical Round Tables

Thank you so much for helping VLDB'20 in the role of technical round table chairs!

The round tables will run as zoom meetings and will be 60 min in duration. They are meant to be discussions (no slides, no panelists).

We recommend the following:
- Invite 3-4 experts in the field to join the round table (they should also ask their students and postdocs to join the round table).
- Prepare a couple of starter questions / statements to get the conversation going.

When you run the round table, spend some time at the beginning for people to introduce themselves and perhaps say something about their own research/interests in this space. Although the details of how you run your round table is up to you.

Thanks again for doing this!
