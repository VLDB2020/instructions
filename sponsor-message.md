Since then, it has provided information necessary for the user’s action and decision making in various fields including housing, schools, cars, weddings, travelling, gourmet, cosmetics, and so forth. During the time, the means of providing information have changed.

### Line

![](https://vldb2020.org/assets/logo/logo_line.svg)

LINE was conceived as a mobile messaging service shortly after the massive earthquake that devastated Japan on March 11, 2011. After the tragedy, it became apparent that there was a fundamental need for a global communication tool that could strengthen human relationships. Just a few months later in June, we launched the LINE messaging app. With this approach, LINE has grown into a social platform with hundreds of millions users worldwide, having a particularly strong focus in the rapidly advancing continent of Asia. Rather than settle for globally standardized services based on a generic approach, we believe that it is essential to respect the culture and norm of each individual country in order to engage users on a very deep level and evolve in each region. We call it culturalization and it’s at the heart of everything we do. In the world we strive to create, users will have seamless online and offline access to all the people, information and services they need in their daily lives – LINE is the gateway. Our journey to evolve into a Smart Portal will continue, as we will meet all needs that our users face in a constantly changing mobile universe. LINE is your daily life companion – Engaging the world with you.
