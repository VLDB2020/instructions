**Before The Conference**:

- Please go to the VLDB'20 conference program (https://vldb2020.org/program.html) and find the primary and the repeat sessions for your paper. The easiest might be to find your name (or paper title) 
in the flat program. Then notice the two session numbers that correspond to the primary and repeat sessions for your paper. For example, one of the first papers in the conference on "Alibaba Hologres"
will be presented in session 03A and repeated in session 52A. **Verify the times** for your paper presentations. The times displayed should be shown in your local time zone.

- Second, please observe that the program indicates if any authors will be available for "Live Q&A" during either the primary or repeat session. One author should be
available during at least one of the two sessions. If you are able to have someone present during both sessions, that would be best, but it is not required. Please 
check that the information about who will be present is accurate. If it is inaccurate, please email the PC chairs (magda@cs.washington.edu and zxf@itee.uq.edu.au).
