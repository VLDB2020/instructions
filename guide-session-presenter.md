## PRESENTATION INSTRUCTIONS 

Congratulations on your paper or demonstration!

**Session Logistics**
- Each session will be a zoom webinar, but we will try to upgrade all attendees to panelist so they can see each other, chat with each other, and in general have a sense
of a community coming together.
- For each paper, we will play the recorded video, and will follow with live Q&A if an author is present.
- Additional questions will be posted on Slack.
- The day of your paper presentation (primary or repeat), please join the zoom webinar a minute or two early. Identify yourself as the author that will be answering
questions for your paper. Please either speak directly or use the zoom chat feature to let the session chair know that you have arrived.
- Once all the papers in the session have been presented, if time permits, there will be a short group discussion.
- During the session, please focus on the zoom videos, the zoom questions, and the zoom discussion.
- After the sesison, please check the slack channel to answer questions about your paper and engage in discussion. We encourage you to continue
checkign the slack channel for the remainder of the conference.

**Zoom and Slack links**: You will find the links to the zoom webinars and the slack channel on the conference program ([https://vldb2020.org/program.html](https://vldb2020.org/program.html)). Just click on your session and you should see buttons for Zoom, Slack, paper pdf, and technical support. 

Please **do NOT share** any zoom links on social media or anywhere else where it might be found by a malicious party.  If you wish to share a link, please use `https://vldb2020.org/program_flat.html?s=[Session ID]`, replacing `[Session ID]` with the 2-digit+letter ID of your session.  (e.g., `https://vldb2020.org/program_flat.html?s=47C`). Registered participants will be able to access the zoom link from this page.

**Before The Conference**:

- Please go to the VLDB'20 conference program (https://vldb2020.org/program.html) and find the primary and the repeat sessions for your paper. The easiest might be to find your name (or paper title) 
in the flat program. Then notice the two session numbers that correspond to the primary and repeat sessions for your paper. For example, one of the first papers in the conference on "Alibaba Hologres"
will be presented in session 03A and repeated in session 52A. **Verify the times** for your paper presentations. The times displayed should be shown in your local time zone.

- Second, please observe that the program indicates if any authors will be available for "Live Q&A" during either the primary or repeat session. One author should be
available during at least one of the two sessions. If you are able to have someone present during both sessions, that would be best, but it is not required. Please 
check that the information about who will be present is accurate. If it is inaccurate, please email the PC chairs (magda@cs.washington.edu and zxf@itee.uq.edu.au).
