## Round Table 5 - Intelligent Data Exploration (Day 2, Block 1) [25r]

> Start at <span class="timeUTC">2020-09-02T12:00:00Z</span>

### 
* Chairs: Georgia Koutrika and Kurt Stockinger

#### Description
Data growth and availability as well as data democratization have radically changed data exploration. Many different data sets, generated by users, systems and sensors, are continuously being collected. These data sets contain information about scientific experiments, health, energy, education etc., and they are highly heterogeneous in nature, ranging from highly structured data in tabular form to unstructured text, images or videos. While the benefit of data exploration becomes increasingly more prominent, the limitations of existing tools make accessing and combining data from different data sources a non-trivial, time-consuming, and often fruitless endeavor. In this round table, we will discuss about what it takes to bridge the gap between users and data, and the new generation of intelligent data exploration tools that are emerging in the intersection of data management, natural language processing, machine learning and visualization.

## Round Table 6 - Making Uncertain Data Management Practical (Day 2, Block 1) [25R]

> Start at <span class="timeUTC">2020-09-02T12:00:00Z</span>

### 
* Chairs: Boris Glavic and Oliver Kennedy
* Other members: Peter Haas, Renee Miller, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, (Leonid Libkin)

#### Description
For several decades now, the database community has been exploring ways to cope with uncertainty in data resulting from outliers, imprecision, missing data, ambiguity in data integration, and more.  Yet, while such data quality issues are a bigger problem than ever, general-purpose solutions for managing uncertainty in data are still nowhere to be found.  In this roundtable, a panel of experts explores the challenges in making uncertain data management practical.

## Round Table 11 - Reproducibility and/or Availability? (Day 3, Block 1) [45r]

> Start at <span class="timeUTC">2020-09-03T12:00:00Z</span>

### 
* Chair: Wolfgang Lehner

#### Description
While other scientific communities have established a comprehensive culture of providing material (code and data) for other researchers to reproduce submitted and/or published research results and eventually to build upon existing work, our community is still at the beginning of implementing such a culture. Submission numbers to the reproducibility check are small, the amount of accepted papers within “Evaluation and Analysis Tracks” is low (and quite often not recognized appropriately). Within this round table discussion, we want to (a) share our current ideas of promoting availability and reproducibility as well as to (b) kick-start a discussion on further activities especially in light of academic and industrial research.

## Round Table 14 - How should publishing practices evolve? (Day 3, Block 2) [50R]

> Start at <span class="timeUTC">2020-09-03T19:00:00Z</span>

### 
* Chair: Divesh Srivastava

#### Description
Although being a conference-driven community, our research model has gradually moved to a journal-style publication model with multiple submission cycles and an extensive revision process. While this development proved extremely beneficial, we are still facing a number of challenges like double blind reviewing, forum-based Q&A mechanisms, out-of-scope discussion, different paper length, promoting surveys, etc. This and more will be the topic of our round table!
